        <p class="pragraphe">Thanksgiving — a much-loved holiday filled with turkey, stuffing, pumpkin pie,
          and other fall favorites — can be anxiety-inducing and challenging for people
          with eating disorders.<br>
         Whether it’s fearing encountering certain foods, worrying about bingeing and
          purging, or anxiety about facing loved ones with whom they have a difficult
          relationship, there’s a lot more going on at the table for people with eating 
         disorders than others may realize.“As a holiday that’s focused almost entirely
          on eating, Thanksgiving emphasizes the very thing those with eating disorders
          are struggling so much with: their relationship with food,” says
          Carrie Wasterlain, LCSW, assistant director of The Dorm, which specializes in
          mental healthcare for young adults in New York City and Washington, D.C.
         Abundant food options, inner pressures to eat — or not eat — or worrying that
          people will judge what you are eating can all make this holiday very challenging, 
         Wasterlain adds.<br>
         “Society has also normalized disordered eating behaviors on this day, whether it’s
          ‘fasting until dinner,’ or ‘eating until I can barely move,’” Wasterlain says.
         The dual pressure to overindulge and then feel guilty for eating large portions can 
         make this holiday feel overwhelming, she adds. And the normalization of those
          behaviors may lead people who struggle with restriction or bingeing to consider
          purging or using laxatives to alleviate feelings of guilt and anxiety, says Wasterlain.
         And while Thanksgiving can be challenging every year, this year’s holiday may be
          especially difficult because of the extra importance placed on being together again
          after having to forgo seeing family during the 2020 holidays, notes
          Landry Weatherston-Yarborough, a certified eating disorder specialist and clinical
          director of the Eating Recovery Center in Denver.</p>
